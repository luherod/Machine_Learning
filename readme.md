# Machine Learning Model for Prediction of Vacation Rental Prices

## About this project

This project involves an in-depth analysis of all variables, including data exploration, preprocessing, and feature selection. Steps include handling missing values, removing redundant columns, standardizing text, encoding categorical variables, detecting and eliminating outliers, and scaling the data. Additionally, a correlation matrix study was conducted to discard redundant features.

For model selection, multiple regression models with regularization were tested using cross-validation, including Lasso and Ridge regression. The final model was chosen based on performance, achieving a test error of 0.39.
